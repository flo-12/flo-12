# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm currently taking part in the program of the 42 school in Berlin, which focuses on C programming.<br><br>Also I'm looking forward to get more experienced with other languages and frameworks in Back- and Frontend-Development.<br><br>In previous jobs and project I was in embedded software development using a model-based approach and working in teams of several hundred people. As a part of that I managed a team, set-up our Jira and designed a DSL (domain specific language), which we used in the prjects.

# ðŸŒ± Interests:
For the future I would like to be involved in meaningful projects that add up to a more Sustainable living. Too unspecific?? -> reach out to me
